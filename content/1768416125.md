It's a crazy game, needed some tinkering to run properly and sometimes give me the vibes that is broken even if it's not, the visuals and the story are blended together in a spectacular way, the world building is insane, and makes no sense, it's based around the fact that music is banned and no bands or concerts are allowed.

The main quest revolves around characters that aren't explained well no backstory, no silly details, the game goes to the point that is taking the player involved in an experience that is not the usual story driven game with walks and a ton of dialogues, but with a well mixed gameplay sequences.

Gameplay that is not crazy, i mean it's not a bad rhythm game but visuals can be messy sometimes and obscure the scene or in other situations where gameplay and dialogues are mixed together it's hard to follow them and don't lose the rhythm.
