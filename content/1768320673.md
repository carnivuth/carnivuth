I liked a lot the gameplay in the first phases, when mechanics were still being explained and the RPG armor crafting component was absent, i didn't like to much that component at first sight and i didn't explore the possibilities behind it, the side quests seems a filler to me, go somewhere to recover item `X` and get it back to the quest's client or go there and kill enemy `X` for some reason and so on.

The Environmental puzzle are simple and not so challenging, just a filler for the combat phases, where the focus is for most of the time. The combat offers a lot to explore with some curious combos and moves that you can unlock trough an experience system and the already mentioned RPG component of the game, but at normal difficulty there is no reason to explore combos if not for the sake of doing it, enemies are easy to take out.

Speaking about enemies, there aren't a lot of enemy types, i think there are like 5 of them and a lot of reskins with different elemental affinities like:

- enemy `X`
- enemy `X` but fire type
- enemy `X` but ice type

Combat get also a little bit annoying in the final phases when the only drive that moves you to the credits is the narrative component where you want to see where the journey of Kratos and Atreus goes and see this story of redemption ending.

Overall a good and solid experience.
