Made progress on the first section of the game in the desert and level up some random classes to optimize the fights, i was getting lost in the map cause a lot of section are designed for backtracking or as a 1 way shortcut.

Need to get used to the skill system before having an idea on the team plan.
The character swapping that seems a little bit confusing cause you need to search the character by looping on them

No progress on the main story but the cut scene in the desert with Mya was fun.

Made progress with the Nopon quest for merchants
