Made progress on the first section of the game in the desert and level up some random classes to optimize the fights, i was getting lost in the map cause a lot of section are designed for backtracking or as a 1 way shortcut.

Need to get used to the skill system and character swapping that seems a little bit confusing cause you need to search the character by looping on them.
