Paradigm to expose services to microservices

- monitoring
- communication
- security
- reliability

This problems arise cause application scale up from monoliths to microservices

## Limits

The service mash is complex due to the erogation of this services

## What is a service mash?

Service mash is an infrastructural service

## implementation

Each microservice has a **proxy sidecar** that manages traffic and all services described above

## Data plane

Where application traffic is

## Control plane

Where system traffic is done

##  ambient mash

The sidecar is moved at namespaces level and pods communicate using zero trust tunnel

## network service mash

Service mash that works at layer 3 level useful for multi-cluster connection
