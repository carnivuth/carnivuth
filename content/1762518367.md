## Why big data

Made data driven decision making based on analytics

## Analytics effects

- descriptive
- diagnostic
- predictive
- prescriptive
- cognitive and artificial intelligence

## Big data

big data are data where data volume or IOPS is not manageable by a normal processing capabilities (typical databases solutions)

### characteristics

- volume
- variety structure or unstructured
- velocity how fast need to process data
- veracity quality of data collected

## Long tail problem

The data needs to be collected without discrimination

## Bigger and smarter ?

Collection means that send data is easy, moving and migrated them is not

## Hardware concerns

Scaling up a single machine to manage big data implies a lot of problems [Scale up vs scale out](/1740697200.md#Scale%20up%20vs%20scale%20out) scale out, scale out is much simpler but problems like

## Distributed filesystem for scale out solutions

In order to scale out resources for big data a [distributed filesystem](/1740697200.md#Gestire%20i%20dati%20in%20infrastrutture%20distribuite%20distributed%20filesystem%20dfs) istributed filesystem is required to share the storage resources , one of the solution is HDFS

### main features of Hadhoop

- HA
- cluster topology and multi-claster solution
- replication between data nodes

## Relational Distributed databases

## platforms for big data

## Lambda architecture

Lambda architecture relies on 2 different paths to collect data:

- a speedy one for real time data manipulation
- a batch one for high quality data
