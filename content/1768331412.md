I bought the game searching for a Pokemon alternative that does not suck and i found this one where monsters are "recorded" using tapes, the idea does not make sense but stuck in my head so i decided to give the game a try, it captured me instantly.

From the start it throws you in this 3D pixel art world where you don't now anything and the game tells you "Don't worry, it's fine", then you start exploring the mechanics, the exploration, the characters and the monsters designs that are incredible.

I personally fall in love with the monster designs and the combat system, with 2 monsters playable it gives me the feels of playing competitive Pokemon in a single player, the boss fights pushed me to think strategies to overcome them and building new tactics is simple and instantaneous cause you don't have to farm endlessly just to increase some numbers of the new beasts, i loved the concept of swapping moves and abilities, also the type system is interesting cause you can strategies with moves from specific types to trigger specific status on your monsters or the enemy ones.

The narrative is direct and simple, find a way home from this strange island. In the meantime become a ranger by defeating the other rangers, but the characters.... the characters just stick with me in a way that i cannot comprehend now, they are simple and straightforward with simple messages and evolution path but in the simplicity the message hits me really hard.

Also the soundtrack is spectacular, with the perfect match for each situation and since the game isn't dubbed they stuck easily in the head.

A spectacular game, made with love and care from the authors
