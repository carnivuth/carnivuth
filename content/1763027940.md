Model context protocol is a standard shipped by [antropicAI](https://www.anthropic.com/) for communication between AI capable application (*claude-desktop, VScode ecc..*) and external tools, the concept is similar to LSP where a sort of proxy component is deployed between the AI application and the external tool:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
subgraph AI_applications
direction TB
A[claude-desktop]
B[vscode]
end
subgraph external_tools
direction TB
D[grafana]
E[github]
F[gitlab]
G[filesystem]
H[database]
end

C{{MCP server}}
AI_applications --JSON RPC--> C -- http/api --> external_tools
```

The MCP server expose an endpoint that talks [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) with a set of defined methods:

- `tools`
- `resources`
- `prompts`

For each of this the following submethods are defined

 - `list`
 - `get`

> [!NOTE]
> For tools and prompts `call` is also implemented
