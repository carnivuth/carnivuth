The `find` command is handy tool to manage files inside the file system, the command structure is:

```bash
find dir criteria [action]
```

Where:

- `dir` is the starting dir
- `criteria` is a filter for the element that have to match
- `action` is the action to perform on the elements that matches the `criteria`

## Limit file search

In order to limit the depth level of the search the ` -maxdepth` option can be used

```bash
find dir -maxdepth <VALUE> criteria [action]
```

## Oneliners

- remove files only in current dir with confirmation

```bash
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f  -exec rm -i {} \;
```

- exclude elements by regex

```bash
find . -not -regex 'REGEX'
```

- filter by element name

```bash
find . -name 'REGEX'
```
