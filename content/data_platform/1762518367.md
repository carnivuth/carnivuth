# Why big data

made data driven decision making based on analytics 

## Automation 

To improve analytics

Analytics  effects

- descriptive 
- diagnostic
- predictive
- prescriptive
- cognitive and artificial intelligence

## Big data

big data are data where data volume or IOPS is not manageable by a normal processing capabilities (typical databases solutions)

### characteristics

- volume  
- variety structure or unstructured
- velocity how fast need to process data
- veracity quality of data collected

## Long tail problem

the data needs to be collected without discrimination

## Bigger and smarter ?

Collection means that send data is easy, moving and migrated them is not

## Hardware concerns

scaling up a single machine to manage big data implies a lot of problems [Scale up vs scale out](1740697200.md#Scale%20up%20vs%20scale%20out) scale out, scale out is much simpler but problems like 

## Distributed filesystem for scale out solutions

In order to scale out resources for big data a distributed filesystem is required to share the storage resources [Gestire i dati in infrastrutture distribuite: distributed filesystem dfs](1740697200.md#Gestire%20i%20dati%20in%20infrastrutture%20distribuite%20distributed%20filesystem%20dfs), one of the solution is HDFS

### main features of hadhoop

- HA
- cluster topology and multiclaster solution
- replication between data nodes

## Distributed databases

### Relational ones

#### pros

- relational algebra
#### issues
- fixed schema that is difficult to update after release
- difficult to scale out due to the schema
- impedence mismatch
- consistency features means that there are locks to maintain

## No sql databases
