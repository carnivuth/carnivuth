# Ad hoc on demand distance vector

AODV tries to address the problem of the variable sized header of [DSR](pages/mobile_systems/manets/dynamic_source_routing.md) by maintain a reduced routing table suitable for manets

## Limit the routing problems of manets

In order to avoid limit the header lenght problem, 2 routing tables are used:

- **inverse path routing table** that is used to route the route reply packets, the records on this table are removed after a timeout

| SOURCE | DESTINATION | DISTANCE FROM THE SOURCE |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| S      | D           | 1                        |

- **direct path routing table** that is used to route the actual traffic to the destination this table does the heavy lifting

|     | DESTINATION | NEXT HOP | DISTANCE FROM THE DESTINATION |
| --- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| S   | D           | F        | 3                             |

c[the destination recives the packet \n and send a route reply packet to the source \n the unicast transmision does not contain the full path \n but exploits the routing tables]

## Route error

In the route error scenario the node that detects the route error situation informs the other nodes like in [DSR](pages/mobile_systems/manets/dynamic_source_routing.md) and they update their routing table, the message is broadcast to the neighbors route error to inform them

## Link failure detection

Extension that force all nodes to send hello messages to the neighbors in order to discover broken routing table lines

## Avoid the flooding propagation

In order to avoid the excessive flooding if an intermediate node has already the route information can respond with  a route reply, this generate some loop problems

### Using dsn to avoid loops

So in order to avoid loops, an integer value is introduced (DSN) that is incremented with each propagation of a route request packet, if the
