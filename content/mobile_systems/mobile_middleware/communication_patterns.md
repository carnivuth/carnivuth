# Communication patterns

Patterns that handle communication between nodes in a mobile environment
## Client initiated connection for push model

Pattern that resolves the problem of reaching the client from the server for server -> client push interactions. the client starts a connection to the server that updates the client status (*e.g. AJAX interaction*)

## Connection factory

Pattern that decouple connection management and application business code by hiding connection details behind a factory component (*used by java mobile edition M.E.*)

## Multiplexed connection

Pattern to allow multiple logic connections to travel on a single level 4 physical connection in order to improve performance instead of creating multiple channels (*e.g. SCTP stream control transfer protocol for multimedia streaming*)
