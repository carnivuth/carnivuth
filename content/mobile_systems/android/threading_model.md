# Android threading model

Android follow a particular threadin model that can be divided in 2 levels, at the kernel level application are executed in different Dalvik VM's and the application is composed by a single java thread that runs the activities

```mermaid
flowchart LR
subgraph linux kernel
direction LR
subgraph app1
A[dalvik VM]
end
subgraph app2
B[dalvik VM]
end
app1 ~~~ app2
end
```

the main thread of the application executes the following looper

```java
while(true){
	Message = m.queue.next();
	if(m!=null){
		m.target.dispatch-message(m);
		m.recycle();
	}
}
```
