# Android platform

Android is a complex platform that offers developers with a mobile middleware that handles common mobile problems, it's composed by 4 layers,

- **linux kernel** a stripped and modified version of the linux kernel
- **system level libraries** C++ libraries to interact with hardware components, modified version of the jvm (*dalvik virtual machine*)
- **application framework** java SDK's for interact with the under level components
- **applications**

In the android platform applications must follow the threading model offered by the platform and must be written in JAVA android compatible

## Android is linux? yes to some extent

The kernel part is based on the linux kernel with some additions and some things that got removed

| KERNEL EXTENSIONS<br>                | DESCRIPTION                                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ASHMEM** shared memory manager<br> | Support for share memory for process communication             |
| **IPC binder**                       | faster inter process communication support based on **ASHMEM** |
| **ADVANCED POWER MANAGEMENT**        | application callable api for managing power consumption        |

Feature removed from the linux system are

- support for Glibc
- window manager support
- no linux utilities

so for this **android is not a fully compatible linux extension**

## Power management with wakelocks

applications can through the wakelocks java API can influence the behavior of the kernel power management ( *this is an example of [cross layering pattern](pages/mobile_systems/mobile_middleware/mobile_middleware_principles.md#cross%20layering%20principle)* )

## Not all the system is java based

Some performance critical components are implemented in C/C++ to improve performance for example the multimedia stack

## Dalvik virtual machine

Implemented in a registry-based model (in order to exploit the ARM architecture of smartphones ), it also run different bytecode of the JAVA standard in order to improve performance (*called .dex also instructions are reduced by 30%* )

## Android sdk main component

Android offers to developers some main concept to interact with the android runtime

| COMPONENT              | DESCRIPTION                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ACTIVITY**           | Main application component that represent an interaction with the user                                |
| **INTENT**             | Request to perform an operation to the android framework (as sharing content)                         |
| **SERVICE**            | codes that runs in the background with no interaction with the user (**no dedicated process/thread**) |
| **BROADCAST RECIEVER** | Application component that handle broadcast messages                                                  |

Other components are available

- **Activity manager** to handle [activity lifecicle](pages/mobile_systems/android/activity.md#activity%20lifecicle) and application management
- **package manager** to handle application management
- **Window Manager & View System**: handle windows on the screen
- **Resource Manager & Content Provider**: handle system resource and data access to them (*e.g. sqlite databases, filesystem*)
- **Telephony, Notification & Location Manager**
