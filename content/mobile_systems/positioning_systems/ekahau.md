# Ekahau

Positioning system that exploits a stochastic model of the environment to compute position avoiding the signal measurement error, the approach is based on [scene analysis](pages/mobile_systems/positioning_systems/base_techniques.md#scene%20analysis) approach

One of the improvements over [RADAR](pages/mobile_systems/positioning_systems/radar.md) is the rail tracking principle that computes position based on the most recent calculated one and by following allowed paths (*e.g. no wallk trough walls*)
