# Global positioning system (gps)

GPS is a positioning system that exploits dedicated hardware (*e.g. satellites*) for improved performance in localization capabilities

The concept is to use [lateration](pages/mobile_systems/positioning_systems/base_techniques.md#lateration) in combination with [toa](pages/mobile_systems/positioning_systems/base_techniques.md) using satellites with known positions

GPS satellites needs to have a perfect synchronized clock, $1_{\mu s}$ can achive an error of around 300 meters

## Differential gps

to reduce the error range of GPS a base station with a fixed position is used to correct the error in the satellites measures
