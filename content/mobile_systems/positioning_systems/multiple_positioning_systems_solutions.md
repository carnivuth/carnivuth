# Multi positioning system solution

In modern devices multiple positioning system are available so there is the need to combine in some way information coming from the different positioning solutions

One of the possiblities it to select with a voting approach as in **VTT solution**

$$
k_n = \frac{1}{t_{age} \ast v + \epsilon}
$$

where:
- $t_{age}$ is the positioning age
- $v$ is the speed
- $\epsilon$ is the accuracy

## Java world solution

Java as determined a standard for positioning systems called PoSIM, under the UNIBO implementation architechture
