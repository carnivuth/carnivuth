# Manet positioning systems
## Assumption based coordinates (abc)

ABC is a positioning system for a [manet](pages/mobile_systems/manets/manets.md) environment, it relies on the concept of **anchor node**.
Each anchor node compute the relative distance between himself and the one-hop nodes around him and maintains an internal map

## Triangulation via extended range and redundant association of intermediate nodes (terrain)

This solution relies on exploiting the maps of the anchor nodes to create a multi hop map of the nodes position
