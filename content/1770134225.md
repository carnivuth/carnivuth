I'm already at half story cause the game has capture me, it's visually stunning with some incredible views of the far west, the characters seem real and the game does an incredible job at making the player feel hunted, out of place and inside a world that does not accept the gang lifestyle anymore.

The gameplay is immersive, the shooting it's fun, nothing special but gets the job done.

The narrative is the real winner here, Dutch van der linde it's an incredible character with an incredible development
