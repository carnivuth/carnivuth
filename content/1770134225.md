I'm already at half story cause the game has capture me, it's visually stunning with some incredible views of the far west, the characters seem real and the game does an incredible job at making the player feel hunted, out of place and inside a world that does not accept the gang lifestyle anymore.

The gameplay is immersive, the shooting it's fun, nothing special but gets the job done.

The narrative is the real winner here, Dutch van der linde it's an incredible character with an incredible development that shows what a man can become when everything tries to test him

The characters are in an horrible situation, followed by the law they are constantly threatened.

Dutch wife has been killed by the Gang after they sold them to the pinkertons and ruined the bank robbery, this episode put dutch in an deeply dark place. And Hartur it's questioning his choices and his leadership
