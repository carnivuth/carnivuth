# Hi i'm Carnivuth 💻

I'm a software engineer with a passion for food, dogs, videogames and open source software, i'm currently working on my master degree at [UNIBO](https://www.unibo.it/it) and i'm also working as a devops engineer and system administrator at [Laboratori Guglielmo Marconi](https://www.labs.it)

My knowledge revolves around architectures, deployment, administration and development of distributed systems with a focus on application and hardware monitoring, i'm also interested in the computer vision and computer graphics fields.
